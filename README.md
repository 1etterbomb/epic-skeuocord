*SkeuoCord requires English (US/UK) to be the selected language for button icon theming, due to the way they're specified in Discord.* 
*If your client is set to another language, the color of the regular icons will be changed and dropshadow filters will be applied to them instead.*

*If you don't want to use SkeuoCord's brand color replacement, use SkeuoCord_NoBrandReplace.theme.css from SkeuoCord's GitHub repo.*
